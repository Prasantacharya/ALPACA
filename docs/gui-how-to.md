# How to use the ALPACA GUI
Welcome to ALPACA, the Automated Logic Processor And Creation Engine.

## Where do I start?
To start with ALPACA, first you need to be sure your program can launch successfully. For more instructions on how to get your environment set up, please view `README.md`.

Once you have confirmed you can launch the application, you can run it and land on the menu screen, which looks like this:
### Menu Image to be inserted here
This will be your main hub to access everything within the app. A few key points to go over, labeled with numbers:
1. Settings Button: This will bring you to the settings screen.
2. New Project Button: This will initiate the process of creating a new project.
3. Exisiting Project Button: This will prompt you to open a ALPACA-compatible file to continue your work on.
4. Help Button: This will bring you to the help screen.

If you are new to ALPACA, you can view all the important information you need in the help menu, including what the project is, how to use the different features of it, and who made it (us!).
