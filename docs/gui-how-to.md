# How to use the ALPACA GUI
Welcome to ALPACA, the Automated Logic Processor And Creation Engine.

## Where do I start?
To start with ALPACA, first you need to be sure your program can launch successfully. For more instructions on how to get your environment set up, please view `README.md`.

Once you have confirmed you can launch the application, you can run it and land on the menu screen, which looks like this:
### Menu Image to be inserted here
This will be your main hub to access everything within the app. A few key points to go over, labeled with numbers:
1. Settings Button: This will bring you to the settings screen.
2. New Project Button: This will initiate the process of creating a new project.
3. Exisiting Project Button: This will prompt you to open a ALPACA-compatible file to continue your work on.
4. Help Button: This will bring you to the help screen.

If you are new to ALPACA, you can view all the important information you need in the help menu, including what the project is, how to use the different features of it, and who made it (us!).

## How can I customize my ALPACA experience?
In order to customize your ALPACA experience, you would have to:
1. Navigate to the Settings Screen by clicking on the settings tab in the main menu
2. Navigate to the setting that you wish to alter
    1. Language: Click on the language drop down menu and select the language you wish to alter
    2. If the language you selected isn't the default, ALPACA will prompt you on whether you wish to make the new language the default
        1. If you want it to be the default, select "yes". Now ALPACA will always display in this new language no matter what
        2. If you don't want it to be the default, select "no". Now ALPACA will be displayed in the new language, but only temporarily (till you close the window)

## What future features can I expect?

### A more in depth settings screen
Right now all one can do with the settings screen is change the language, in the future you can expect more options such as the ability to change the size of the screen (as well as set a default value) as well as possible hotkey configs (think allowing users to set certain key combinations to do certain things).
